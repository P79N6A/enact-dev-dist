# webos-meta-webpack-plugin
Webpack plugin that automatically detects and copies webOS meta assets.

###Usage
Simply include the plugin within your webpack configuration and both the `./appinfo.json` and `./webos-meta/appinfo.json` will be checked for existence.
If an appinfo is found, it will be scanned for any related webOS meta assets (icons, etc.) and copy them over at build time as well.

Additionally, if [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) is in use, the appinfo title value will be used in the 
generated HTML file.

Full details on valid webOS appinfo.json properties are available at https://developer.lge.com/webOSTV/develop/web-app/app-developer-guide/app-metadata/
