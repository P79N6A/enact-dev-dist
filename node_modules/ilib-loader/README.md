# ilib-loader
---------------------
Webpack loader for copying and configuring iLib locale and resource data.

Within enyo-i18n, it copies the locale assets to the output directory, if needed, and returns the string filepath relative to the output directory.  If the environment variable ILIB_LOCALE_PATH is specified, then it will skip copying files and return that path (to allow for an overrided ilib locale directory in the filesystem). The ilib-loader will also copy app-level `./resources` directory, generating an `ilibmanifest.json` if needed.

For the average user, ilib-loader will never be used.  The only time it may be permissable to use ilib-loader is for a library or app to declare and reference a custom resource-bundle to be parsed by iLib. For example:
```
import myResBundlePath from `ilib!./assets/myresbundle';
// The myResBundlePath variable is the string filepath to the bundle relative to the output directory
// By using ilib-loader, all the contained bundle files are copied over successully as assets
```
